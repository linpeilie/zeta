# Accessibility

Flutter accessibility auditing and remediation across WCAG 2.2 conformance levels A, AA, and AAA. The skill is split into a workflow (this file) plus reference files loaded on demand:

- [`references/audit-templates.md`](references/audit-templates.md) — severity guide, report template, level-specific passed-check lists for A, AA, AA + selected AAA, and AAA. Also includes cross-platform severity adjustment table.
- [`references/examples.md`](references/examples.md) — extended Flutter code per category, including WCAG 2.2 patterns (focus-not-obscured, dragging alternatives, Cupertino semantic wrappers, MergeSemantics correctness).
- [`references/widget-mapping.md`](references/widget-mapping.md) — table mapping each Flutter widget to its accessibility requirement and the recommended implementation. Use it when auditing a specific widget.
- [`references/testing.md`](references/testing.md) — complete accessibility test suite covering semantics, touch targets, focus management, contrast, text scaling, and motion. Use it when writing the tests that lock in a remediation.
- [`references/platforms/ios.md`](references/platforms/ios.md), [`android.md`](references/platforms/android.md), [`web.md`](references/platforms/web.md), [`macos.md`](references/platforms/macos.md), [`windows.md`](references/platforms/windows.md), [`linux.md`](references/platforms/linux.md) — per-platform WCAG 2.2 checks. Load only the file(s) matching the selected platform(s).

Read whichever reference file matches the current phase. Do not duplicate its content here.

## Core Standards

Apply these standards to all accessibility work:

**Conformance Level** — Begin every audit by asking which WCAG 2.2 conformance level the project targets (A, AA, AA + selected AAA, or AAA). Never assume AA.

**Platform Selection** — Begin every audit by asking which of the six platforms are targeted (iOS, Android, Web, macOS, Windows, Linux). Apply the platform rules from the matching file(s) in `references/platforms/`.

**Image Semantics** (WCAG 1.1.1) — Every `Image` must have `semanticLabel`, or be wrapped in `Semantics(label:)`. Decorative images use `excludeFromSemantics: true`.

**Gesture Detector** (WCAG 2.1.1) — Never use bare `GestureDetector` for tap targets. Use `InkWell`, `ElevatedButton`, `TextButton`, or `IconButton`. `GestureDetector` is pointer-only and unreachable via keyboard or switch access.

**Target Size** (WCAG 2.5.8) — Target Size Minimum is 24x24 CSS px (≈ 24 dp) at AA. The VGV recommended minimum is 48x48 dp. Findings between 24 dp and 48 dp are flagged as VGV-style at AA, and as WCAG findings at AAA via 2.5.5 (44 dp).

**Drag Alternatives** (WCAG 2.5.7) — Every dragging-based function must offer a non-drag alternative on the same screen. Sliders need keyboard or stepper alternatives. `Dismissible` needs an explicit delete button. `ReorderableListView` needs up/down or "move to" controls.

**Focus Not Obscured** (WCAG 2.4.11) — A focused widget must not be entirely obscured by sticky headers, snackbars, bottom sheets, persistent FABs, or overlays. Use `Scrollable.ensureVisible` and `Scaffold.resizeToAvoidBottomInset: true`.

**Color Differentiation** (WCAG 1.4.1) — Never use color as the sole differentiator. Always pair color with a label, icon, or shape.

**Animation and Motion** (WCAG 2.3.3) — All animations must respect `MediaQuery.disableAnimations`. Gate every `AnimationController`, `AnimatedContainer`, `Hero` transition, and `PageRouteBuilder` transition on this flag.

**Icon Buttons** (WCAG 4.1.2) — Icon-only buttons must have a `Tooltip` or `Semantics(label:)`. Screen readers have no other way to convey purpose.

**Exclude Semantics** (WCAG 1.1.1) — Never use `ExcludeSemantics` on non-decorative content.

**Text Containers** (WCAG 1.4.4) — Fixed-height containers must not wrap `Text`. Use `minHeight` constraints. Fixed heights clip text at 1.5x font scale on Android, sooner on iOS where Larger Accessibility Sizes go to ~3.1x.

**Contrast** (WCAG 1.4.3) — All text and UI components must meet the contrast ratio for the selected WCAG level. See the WCAG Level Criteria Reference section below.

**Cupertino Semantics** (WCAG 4.1.2) — Cupertino widgets (`CupertinoSwitch`, `CupertinoSlider`, `CupertinoSegmentedControl`, `CupertinoButton`) ship with weaker semantic defaults than their Material equivalents. Always wrap them in `Semantics(label:, value:, button:)`.

**Autofill Hints** (WCAG 1.3.5) — Every `TextField` collecting structured personal data (email, username, password, name, address, phone, oneTimeCode) must declare `autofillHints`. Required for 1.3.5 at AA and the foundation for 3.3.7 Redundant Entry at A.

**Async Announcements** (WCAG 4.1.3) — Every async user-visible state change must announce itself via `Semantics(liveRegion: true)` or `SemanticsService.announce`.

---

## Workflow

Every accessibility engagement follows four phases in sequence. Do not skip Phase 1 or Phase 2.

### Phase 1: Conformance Level Selection

Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask:

```yaml
question: "Which WCAG 2.2 conformance level are you targeting?"
header: "WCAG level"
options:
  - label: "A"
    description: "Removes the most critical barriers. Includes the new 2.2 criteria 3.2.6 Consistent Help and 3.3.7 Redundant Entry."
  - label: "AA"
    description: "Standard most regulators require. Adds contrast, resize text, focus visible, plus the four new 2.2 AA criteria: 2.4.11, 2.5.7, 2.5.8, 3.3.8."
  - label: "AA + selected AAA"
    description: "AA across the app, plus specific AAA criteria scoped to flagged flows. Common: 1.4.6 enhanced contrast, 2.2.3 no timing, 2.4.13 focus appearance."
  - label: "AAA"
    description: "Full AAA. 7:1 contrast, no timing, no exceptions to keyboard. Rare for whole products."
```

If the user picks "AA + selected AAA", follow up with a free-text request for the AAA criterion IDs they want included (for example, "1.4.6, 2.2.3, 2.4.13").

**Outcome:** Record the selected level. All audit checks, criterion citations, and fix recommendations apply only the rules for that level (plus all levels below it) and any opted-in AAA criteria.

### Phase 2: Platform Selection

Use `AskUserQuestion` (multi-select if available, otherwise one question with a comma-separated reply) to ask:

```yaml
question: "Which platforms is this app targeting? Select all that apply."
header: "Platforms"
options:
  - label: "iOS"
    description: "VoiceOver, Switch Control, Dynamic Type up to 3.1x, Voice Control, Bold Text, Reduce Motion, Reduce Transparency."
  - label: "Android"
    description: "TalkBack, Switch Access, font scale up to 2x, Voice Access, color inversion."
  - label: "Web"
    description: "Flutter Web rendered to a Semantics-mapped DOM. NVDA + Chrome, JAWS + Chrome, VoiceOver + Safari."
  - label: "macOS"
    description: "VoiceOver, Full Keyboard Access, Reduce Motion, Increase Contrast."
  - label: "Windows / Linux desktop"
    description: "Narrator, NVDA, JAWS (Windows), Orca (Linux), Windows High Contrast Mode."
```

**Outcome:** Record the selected platforms. Load the matching file(s) from `references/platforms/` (for example, `references/platforms/ios.md` for iOS, `references/platforms/android.md` for Android). Load only the files for platforms that were selected; do not load unnecessary files.

### Phase 3: Level-Appropriate, Platform-Aware Audit

For each selected platform, audit the provided files or widgets across seven categories, in order:

1. **Semantics and Screen Reader** — Labels, roles, live regions, merge/exclude correctness, Cupertino semantic gaps, reading order under TalkBack and VoiceOver.

2. **Touch Targets and Dragging Alternatives** — WCAG 2.2 2.5.8 minimum (24 CSS px) at AA, 2.5.5 enhanced (44 CSS px) at AAA, VGV recommended 48 dp, plus 2.5.7 dragging alternatives.

3. **Focus and Keyboard Navigation** — Operability, traversal order, dialog focus trapping, focus indicators, plus 2.4.11 / 2.4.12 focus-not-obscured.

4. **Color Contrast** — Text and UI component ratios at the selected level's threshold (table below).

5. **Text Scaling** — No fixed-height text containers, no clamped text scaling. Cap simulations at 2x on Android and Web, 3x on iOS.

6. **Animation and Motion** — `disableAnimations` gating across `AnimationController`, `Hero`, `AnimatedContainer`, `PageRouteBuilder`. No content flashing above 3 Hz at AA, zero flashing at AAA.

7. **Forms, Authentication, and Help** — `autofillHints` (1.3.5, 3.3.7), accessible authentication (3.3.8 / 3.3.9), consistent placement of help mechanisms (3.2.6).

Apply only criteria active at the selected level (plus opted-in AAA) and relevant to the selected platforms.

For each finding, capture: file path and approximate line number, WCAG criterion ID + name + version (2.0 / 2.1 / 2.2), platform(s) affected, severity (CRITICAL / MAJOR / MINOR), current behavior, expected behavior, Flutter fix as a before-and-after diff.

**Outcome:** After completing all seven categories, produce the Audit Report using the template in [`references/audit-templates.md`](references/audit-templates.md). Pick the level-specific passed-check list that matches Phase 1.

### Phase 4: Remediation Scope Selection

After delivering the report, use `AskUserQuestion`:

```yaml
question: "The audit is complete. How would you like to proceed with fixes?"
header: "Fix scope"
options:
  - label: "All issues"
    description: "Fix every CRITICAL, MAJOR, and MINOR finding"
  - label: "Critical + Major only"
    description: "Fix blockers and significant barriers; skip MINOR polish items"
  - label: "Critical only"
    description: "Fix only what blocks assistive technology users entirely"
  - label: "Specific findings"
    description: "List the finding numbers you want fixed"
```

**Outcome:** Apply exactly the fixes the user selects. After applying fixes, confirm: "Fixed [N] findings ([severities]). [N remaining] remain open."

Write tests covering every fix so it cannot regress. See [`references/testing.md`](references/testing.md) for a suite spanning all seven audit categories, and [`references/widget-mapping.md`](references/widget-mapping.md) when the correct implementation for a specific widget is unclear.

## WCAG 2.2 Level Criteria Reference

Level AA includes all Level A criteria. Level AAA includes all Level A and AA criteria. The "Version" column flags whether the criterion is from WCAG 2.0, 2.1, or 2.2. WCAG 2.2 removed 4.1.1 Parsing.

## Quick Anti-Pattern Reference

Full code samples and corrected versions live in [`references/examples.md`](references/examples.md). The patterns below are the ones the skill flags most often.

### Semantics (WCAG 1.1.1, 4.1.2)

```dart
// WRONG: empty label, no label, ExcludeSemantics over actionable
Image.asset('assets/warning.png', semanticLabel: '')
Image.asset('assets/chart.png')
ExcludeSemantics(child: ElevatedButton(onPressed: _submit, child: const Text('Submit')))
```

```dart
// WRONG: Cupertino without semantic wrapper
CupertinoSwitch(value: _enabled, onChanged: _onChanged)
```

```dart
// WRONG: MergeSemantics around an interactive child folds the button's role away
MergeSemantics(
  child: Row(children: [const Text('Item'), IconButton(onPressed: _delete, icon: ...)]),
)
```

### Touch Targets and Dragging (WCAG 2.5.8, 2.5.7)

```dart
// WRONG: 16x16 target, below WCAG 2.2 2.5.8 AA (24 dp)
SizedBox(width: 16, height: 16, child: GestureDetector(onTap: _onTap, child: const Icon(Icons.close, size: 16)))
```

```dart
// WRONG: Dismissible with no non-drag alternative (WCAG 2.2 2.5.7)
Dismissible(key: ValueKey(item.id), onDismissed: (_) => _delete(item), child: ListTile(title: Text(item.name)))
```

### Focus (WCAG 2.1.1, 2.4.11)

```dart
// WRONG: GestureDetector is not keyboard-accessible
GestureDetector(onTap: _onTap, child: const Text('Click me'))
```

```dart
// WRONG: bottom bar covers focused TextField (WCAG 2.2 2.4.11)
Scaffold(
  resizeToAvoidBottomInset: false,
  bottomNavigationBar: const BottomAppBar(child: ...),
  body: ListView(children: [..., TextField(focusNode: _last), ...]),
)
```

### Text Scaling and Motion (WCAG 1.4.4, 2.3.3)

```dart
// WRONG: clips text at 1.5x font scale
SizedBox(height: 48, child: Text('Status: Ready'))
```

```dart
// WRONG: animation always plays
AnimatedContainer(duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 500), color: ..., child: child)
```
