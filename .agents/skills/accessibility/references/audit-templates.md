# Accessibility — Audit Report Templates

Audit report templates for WCAG 2.2 conformance levels (A, AA, AA + selected AAA, AAA), with severity guide, the report template, and per-level passed-check lists. Findings reference WCAG 2.2 criterion IDs and call out the version (2.0, 2.1, or 2.2) so readers can trace the source.

---

## Severity Guide

| Severity | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **CRITICAL** | Blocks assistive technology users entirely. Fix before merging. |
| **MAJOR** | Significant barrier. Fix in current sprint. |
| **MINOR** | Degraded experience or polish item. Schedule for next sprint. |

Severity assignment:

- **CRITICAL**. Criterion applies at the selected level AND the issue completely blocks the use case (no semantic label on a primary action, `GestureDetector` on a required flow, focused field obscured by a sticky bar, target below 24 dp, drag-only operation with no alternative, puzzle CAPTCHA with no alternative).
- **MAJOR**. Criterion applies at the selected level AND the issue significantly degrades the experience (contrast fails by more than one point, target between 24 and 48 dp at AA, dialog does not trap focus, `Dismissible` only exposes a button after a swipe).
- **MINOR**. Criterion applies AND the issue is a refinement (contrast fails marginally, live region missing on non-critical status, focus border 1 px instead of 2 px, redundant entry on a single optional field).

## Cross-Platform Severity Adjustments

The same code path can produce different severities per platform. Use this table to decide how to assign severity per platform when listing a finding.

| Issue | iOS | Android | Web | macOS | Win/Linux |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GestureDetector` for tap | CRITICAL | CRITICAL | CRITICAL | CRITICAL | CRITICAL |
| 16x16 target (below 24 dp) | CRITICAL | CRITICAL | CRITICAL | MAJOR | MAJOR |
| 36 dp target (between 24 and 48 dp) | MAJOR | MAJOR | MAJOR | MINOR | MINOR |
| `Dismissible` without delete button | CRITICAL | CRITICAL | MAJOR | MAJOR | MAJOR |
| Focused field obscured by sticky bottom bar | CRITICAL | CRITICAL | MAJOR | MAJOR | MAJOR |
| `AnimatedContainer` ignoring disableAnimations | MAJOR | MAJOR | MAJOR | MAJOR | MAJOR |
| Tooltip > 80 chars | MINOR | MINOR | MAJOR | MINOR | MINOR |
| `setApplicationSwitcherDescription` for page title | n/a | n/a | CRITICAL | n/a | n/a |
| Bypass blocks missing | n/a | n/a | MAJOR | n/a | n/a |
| Cupertino widget without semantic wrapper | MAJOR | MINOR | MINOR | MAJOR | MINOR |
| Hardcoded Color outside ThemeExtension | MINOR | MINOR | MINOR | MAJOR | MAJOR (Windows HCM) |

Severities in this table assume the criterion is active at the selected level. Findings for criteria above the selected level (for example, AAA criteria when AA is selected) are dropped from the report unless the criterion is in the user's "selected AAA" list from Phase 1.

## Passed Checks — Level A

```text
- [x] A · Semantics & Screen Reader — images/icons have semantic labels; roles correct (1.1.1, 1.3.1, 4.1.2)
- [x] B · Touch Targets — interactive elements present (size assessed at AA)
- [x] C · Focus & Keyboard — all interactions keyboard-reachable; no traps (2.1.1, 2.1.2)
- [x] D · Color — color is never sole differentiator (1.4.1)
- [x] E · Text Scaling — no fixed-height text containers
- [x] F · Animation — no content flashes > 3 Hz (2.3.1)
- [x] G · Forms & Help — form errors identified in text (3.3.1); labels present (3.3.2)
- [x] H · Redundant Entry — multi-step forms reuse session data (3.3.7, WCAG 2.2)

- [x] J · Status Messages — async updates announced via liveRegion or SemanticsService (4.1.3)
- [x] K · Web only — bypass blocks (2.4.1) and page titled (2.4.2) in place
```

## Passed Checks — Level AA (Level A plus these)

```text
- [x] B · Target Size Minimum — all targets >= 24x24 CSS px (2.5.8, WCAG 2.2)
- [x] B · Dragging Alternatives — every drag operation has a single-pointer alternative (2.5.7, WCAG 2.2)
- [x] C · Focus Visible — keyboard focus indicator always visible (2.4.7)
- [x] C · Focus Not Obscured (Min) — focused widget never entirely hidden by sticky/overlay content (2.4.11, WCAG 2.2)
- [x] D · Color Contrast — normal text >= 4.5:1, large text >= 3:1, UI components >= 3:1 (1.4.3, 1.4.11)

## Per-Platform Annotations on Findings

When multiple platforms are selected, every finding's Platform(s) row should be a comma-separated list. The same code path can produce different severities per platform. Example:

```markdown
### 3. SnackBar overlays focused TextField at the bottom of the form
- **File:** lib/checkout/checkout_view.dart ~L88
- **WCAG:** 2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) (Level AA, WCAG 2.2)
- **Platform(s):** iOS (CRITICAL), Android (CRITICAL), Web (MAJOR), macOS (MAJOR), Windows/Linux (MAJOR)
- **Severity:** CRITICAL (mobile), MAJOR (desktop, web)
- **Issue:** When the keyboard opens on iOS or Android, the SnackBar pushes up and entirely covers the focused TextField. On desktop and web the TextField stays partially visible but the SnackBar still occludes the bottom edge.
- **Fix:** [diff]
```

If a finding only applies to a subset of selected platforms, list only those platforms and add a note in the Issue field explaining which platforms were checked but not affected.
