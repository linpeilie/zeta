  Drives a Dart or Flutter package to a fully green state through an autonomous

when_to_use: >
  Use when the user wants a Dart or Flutter package driven to a fully passing
  state, or says things like "green gate", "make it green", "get this package
  passing", "get CI green", "fix all the analyze and test failures", "clean this
  package up before I open a PR", "bring coverage to 100", or "loop until
  everything passes". Use it for questions *about* the gates as well as for a
  run: "which tools would you run, in what order, and what arguments", "walk me
  through the plan before you touch anything", "confirm the package is green",
  "just re-check coverage", "should I add a coverage ignore comment", "what
  should be excluded from coverage", or "can we drop the coverage threshold to
  90". Answer those from this skill instead of improvising a shell-command plan.
  Prefer this over the single-gate testing or analysis skills whenever the
  request spans multiple gates, asks to fix and re-verify until clean, or asks
  how one of the four gates is configured.

# Green Gate

Autonomous quality-gate loop for Dart and Flutter packages. Runs four gates —
analyze, format, test, coverage — reads real tool output, edits code and tests
to fix failures, and loops until one final iteration proves all four pass
simultaneously with observed numbers. Acts autonomously on objective failures;
escalates only on stalls, genuine ambiguity, or infrastructure failure.

This skill orchestrates tools and edits files. It defers the *how* of writing
tests to the `testing` skill — it never duplicates mocking, structure, or
coverage-pattern guidance.

---

## Core Standards

Apply these to ALL green-gate work:

- **MCP tools only, never the Bash equivalent** — analyze via
  `mcp__dart__analyze_files`, format via `mcp__dart__dart_format`, test and coverage
  via `mcp__very-good-cli__test`. Every gate has an MCP tool; none of them runs
  through a shell command. The Bash test path (`very_good test`, `flutter test`,
  `dart test`) is hook-blocked by `block-cli-workarounds.sh` and will be denied, and
  `dart analyze` / `dart format` via Bash are redundant with the MCP tools.
  **Bash is reserved for parsing `coverage/lcov.info` — nothing else.**
- **A plan-only request is still this skill's job** — when the user asks which
  tools, which arguments, or what order the gates run in and does not want a run
  yet, answer from this skill: the same tool calls (`mcp__dart__analyze_files`
  with `applyFixes: true`, `mcp__dart__dart_format`, `mcp__very-good-cli__test`
  with the coverage triple), in gate order, with the precedence rule that makes
  the order matter. Never substitute an improvised shell plan of `flutter
  analyze` / `flutter test --coverage` for the tools the loop actually runs.
- **Never cache green** — re-evaluate every gate every round. Fixing analyze or
  test failures and writing new test files shifts both formatting and the
  coverage denominator, so a previously green gate can regress.
- **Exit only on observed numbers** — the loop terminates only after a single
  final iteration in which analyze is clean, format reports zero changes, all
  tests pass, and `min_coverage` is satisfied, all observed in the same round.
  Declaring success from memory is forbidden; confirm success only with the
  actual numbers observed in that final round.
- **Pass `coverage: true`, `min_coverage`, and `check_ignore: true` together** —
  omitting `coverage: true` silently produces no `lcov.info` (mimics a
  misconfiguration); omitting `check_ignore: true` makes the `// coverage:ignore`
  remedy a no-op.
- **Defer test-writing to the `testing` skill** — when a fix requires authoring
  tests, follow `skills/testing/SKILL.md` for structure, mocking, and naming.
- **Fix root causes, not symptoms** — never weaken a gate to pass it (do not
  delete failing assertions, lower the target to dodge work, or `// coverage:ignore`
  reachable code). Escalate genuine product/API decisions instead of guessing.
- **Act autonomously on objective failures** — analyzer errors, red tests, and
  coverage gaps are fixed without re-prompting. Escalate only per the matrix.

---

## The Loop

For each package root (see **Recursive / Monorepo**), run this algorithm:

1. **Discover** — resolve the package root (the `directory` argument or the
   workspace root); confirm a `pubspec.yaml` exists. Initialize loop state
   (iteration counter `0`, empty fingerprints, empty touched-files set).
2. **Analyze** — run `mcp__dart__analyze_files` with `applyFixes: true`. If any
   errors remain, this is the active gate. Fix, record the fingerprint, go to
   step 7.
3. **Format** — run `mcp__dart__dart_format` on the package root. It reformats
   the whole package in place. If it reports changed files, the gate is now
   green for the next round.
4. **Test** — only if analyze is green this round. Run `mcp__very-good-cli__test`
   with the coverage parameters from **Test Gate**. If tests fail, fix, record
   the fingerprint, go to step 7.
5. **Coverage** — only if tests pass this round. The MCP `min_coverage` result is
   authoritative pass/fail. Parse `coverage/lcov.info` for the displayed
   percentage and per-file fix targets (advisory). If below target, author tests
   for the ranked under-covered files (via the `testing` skill), go to step 7.
6. **Exit** — if all four gates are green in *this same iteration*, confirm
   success with the observed numbers and stop. This is the only exit-green path.
7. **Re-verify** — increment the iteration counter, recompute the failure
   fingerprint, check escalation triggers (no progress, oscillation, cap). If a
   trigger fires, escalate; otherwise loop back to step 2 and re-evaluate **every**
   gate.

**One-pass no-op path** — invoked on an already-green package, iteration 1
finds analyze clean, format reporting zero changes, all tests passing, and
coverage at or above target. The loop confirms green and exits without
editing a single file. A green package costs exactly one verify iteration.

---

## Loop State

State carried across iterations — without it, "no progress" is undecidable:

| State                                          | Purpose                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Iteration counter**                          | Enforce the cap (default 5, per package)                                        |
| **Per-gate failure fingerprint (prior round)** | Detect no-progress and oscillation                                              |
| **Files touched this round**                   | Distinguish a no-op round from a no-progress round; populate escalation reports |

Fingerprint keys per gate:

| Gate         | Fingerprint                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Analyze**  | Sorted set of `diagnosticCode @ file:line`                   |
| **Format**   | Set of files the format gate rewrote (empty = green)         |
| **Test**     | Set of failing test IDs / names                              |
| **Coverage** | Observed percentage + sorted set of under-covered `SF` files |

Definitions:

- **No progress** — the current failure fingerprint is identical to the prior
  round's, or its failure count did not decrease. Escalate.
- **Oscillation** — the same two gates trade green/red across two consecutive
  rounds (e.g. a format fix re-breaks analyze, whose fix re-breaks format).
  Escalate.

---

## Gate Precedence

Fixed order: **analyze → format → test → coverage**. Two rules govern it:

1. **A downstream gate is not assessed until the upstream gate is green this
   round.** A red analyzer can make tests fail to compile; coverage is
   meaningless when tests do not pass — never parse `lcov.info` after a compile
   failure. Format runs after analyze so its reformatting does not churn over
   code that analyze's `applyFixes` is about to rewrite.
2. **Every gate is re-evaluated every round; green is never cached.** Exit
   requires all four green in the same final iteration.

---

## Analyze Gate

- Run `mcp__dart__analyze_files` with `applyFixes: true` so quick fixes are
  applied before diagnostics return. `roots` takes `[{ root: "file:///abs/path" }]`
  — a `file:` URI of the package root. There is **no recursive flag**; the skill
  enumerates package roots itself and passes each.
- The gate is green when zero **errors** remain. Treat error-severity diagnostics
  as blocking; address warnings and infos as well when they are within scope of
  the fix, but do not let an unrelated pre-existing info block the gate.
- **Hook interplay** — the PostToolUse `analyze.sh` hook fires on every
  Edit/Write and exits 2 (blocking) when a fix introduces a new analyze error.
  Treat that rejection as analyze-gate feedback in the same round, not a separate
  failure mode: the edit did not land, so revise it.

---

## Format Gate

- Run `mcp__dart__dart_format` each round. `roots` takes the same
  `[{ root: "file:///abs/path" }]` shape as `analyze_files`; omit the optional
  `paths` so it formats the **whole package** in place. That makes the gate
  observation-based (it catches manual edits and pre-existing drift, not just
  files the loop edited) and self-fixing (one call leaves the package green; a
  second call reports zero changes).
- **Read the changed count, not the status** — the tool succeeds whether or not it
  rewrote anything, so a non-error result proves nothing. Its output ends in
  `Formatted N files (M changed)`; the gate is green only when `M` is `0`. On a
  round where `M` is non-zero the files are already fixed, so re-run the gate next
  round to observe the `0` rather than declaring it green from the fix.
- **Why format is a real gate, not just the hook** — the PostToolUse `format.sh`
  hook fires only on files the loop edits via Edit/Write. A hand-edited or
  pre-existing unformatted file the loop never touches would otherwise pass
  green-gate and then fail CI. The whole-package format closes that gap.

---

## Test Gate

- Run `mcp__very-good-cli__test` with `coverage: true`, `min_coverage: <target>`,
  `check_ignore: true`, and the `exclude_coverage` glob (below).
- **Dart vs Flutter** — omit `dart` to let the tool auto-detect (Flutter is run
  when a Flutter project is detected). Pass `dart: true` only for a pure Dart
  package the tool would otherwise misclassify.
- **`directory`** — pass it when the package is not at the workspace root
  (monorepo sub-packages); omit it only when `pubspec.yaml` is at the root.
- **`timeout_seconds`** — always set a cap (e.g. `120`). Flutter tests hang
  indefinitely when `pumpAndSettle()` runs without a timeout; the cap kills the
  run instead of stalling the loop. A timeout kill is a tool failure, not a test
  failure — escalate it per the matrix.
- The gate is green when every test passes. A failing test is fixed
  autonomously unless it encodes a genuine product decision (escalate per the
  matrix).

---

## Coverage Gate

The MCP `min_coverage` result is **authoritative** for pass/fail. The
`coverage/lcov.info` parse is **advisory** — it supplies the displayed
percentage and per-file fix targets.

- **Default target is `100`** (VGV's house standard), **overridable per
  invocation** (e.g. `80`) for legacy or non-template packages. Generated files
  leave the denominator via `exclude_coverage` and `check_ignore: true` honors
  `// coverage:ignore`, so 100% means 100% of testable, hand-written code.
- **Default `exclude_coverage`** — `**/*.{g,freezed,gen}.dart` plus generated and
  l10n directories. One glob string (brace expansion; fall back to `**/*.g.dart`
  if a CLI build does not honor it).
- **Pass `coverage: true`, `min_coverage`, and `check_ignore: true` together** —
  see **Core Standards**.
- **When `coverage/lcov.info` is missing or below target**, follow the decision
  tree and parsing rules in [`references/coverage.md`](references/coverage.md) —
  it covers the three absence causes, stale-lcov handling, the lcov record fields
  (`SF`/`LF`/`LH`/`DA`), the advisory-mirrors-the-gate rule, and the
  `check_ignore` Dart-only limitation.

---

## Fixing

- **Fix only failing items** — address the diagnostics, tests, or under-covered
  files surfaced this round. Do not refactor unrelated code (YAGNI).
- **Coverage fixes = author tests** — for each ranked under-covered `SF` file,
  write tests following `skills/testing/SKILL.md`. Prioritize files by uncovered
  line count (`LF - LH`).
- **Bound files per round** — fix a coherent batch, then re-verify. Re-running
  the gates after each batch is what makes "no progress" detectable and prevents
  fixing one gate while silently breaking another.
- **Never weaken a gate** — no deleted assertions, no lowered target to dodge
  work, no `// coverage:ignore` on reachable code.

| **Unreachable-code coverage gap** | Suggest `// coverage:ignore` (requires `check_ignore: true`, Dart-only) rather than chasing 100%                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Denominator hygiene**           | A generated file not matched by the exclude glob — widen `exclude_coverage`, not `// coverage:ignore`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Tool / hook failure**           | MCP test timeout (`timeout_seconds` kill), analyzer crash, CLI-missing hook denial (escalate with the install hint `dart pub global activate very_good_cli`), or a *repeated* `analyze.sh` rejection that still blocks a needed edit after revision — a single rejection is in-loop analyze-gate feedback (see **Analyze Gate**), not an escalation |

When escalating, name the gate that is red — analyze, format, test, or coverage —
then give its fingerprint entries verbatim (`diagnosticCode @ file:line` for
analyze, failing test names for test, under-covered `SF` paths for coverage),
the files touched, the iteration count, and the one decision the user must make.
A summary count ("4 errors remain") is not a report; the user cannot act on it.

**A standing instruction to keep going does not override a trigger.** "Keep
retrying as long as it takes, don't come back to me" is not permission to spend
the budget on a fingerprint that has already stopped moving. Stop at the trigger,
report, and wait.

---

## Recursive / Monorepo

- **All packages must pass** — continue on failure (fix every failing package),
  then confirm each package's result. One package's red gate does not abort the others.
- **Per-package iteration budget** — the cap of 5 is per package, not global, so
  a 12-package monorepo does not exhaust a global budget on package one.
- **Shared package-root discovery** — walk for `pubspec.yaml` files. The
  `analyze_files` `roots` set must match the package set
  `mcp__very-good-cli__test --recursive` (`recursive: true`) covers.
- **lcov path is `<package>/coverage/lcov.info`** — resolved per discovered root.
- **Single `min_coverage` applies to all packages** — documented limitation: the
  tool schema has no per-package coverage override. State the shared target when
  confirming coverage.
